# Eternals

> Eternasl is a node based cli application that let you create react application with various templates such react with tailwind css, style component, bootstrap, redux etc.





## Problem Statement

> Let's say we want to create react application with tailwind css. This can be achieved by either of the following ways:


#### Solution 1

* Install React application
* Visite Tailwind Docs 
* Then Install it

(Trust me this consumes your precious time & can be anoying sometime)

#### Step 2

* Google any react-tailwind starter template
* If found then download it.
* Else follow Solution 1
